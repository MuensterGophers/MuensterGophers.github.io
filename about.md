Münster GO Usergroup. Programming and Hacking in GO. 

Kubernetes, docker, etcd, terraform, consul, influxDB are just some of many well-known examples of software written in ‘go’. ‘Go’ is slim, has a flat learning curve - and is just cool. We want to use this group to gather and share experiences with go, and to learn from each other.
